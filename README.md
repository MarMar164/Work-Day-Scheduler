This is a working scheduler using bootstrap and moment.js I used bootsrap for almost all of the html making the work very quick I looked at
bootstrap and put a list element and then nested a textbox inside of it with a save button
from there I gave them all classes with times of the day and comapired them to moment with in a for loop to see if they were = < or > 
the applyed the class based of of that, and form there I was done making the scheduler
